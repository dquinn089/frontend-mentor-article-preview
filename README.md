## Overview

This is my submission for my eighth Frontend Mentor project, built with HTML/CSS and Javascript. For this project I referenced my [product-preview-card](https://github.com/dquinn089/frontend-mentor-product-preview-card) for styling and design, since the design and layout for that project were very similar. Although there wasn't much Javascript needed, it still took a while and was very much a learning curve to get the script to work. Since there wasn't much JS, I decided I might as well keep it within the HTML instead of linking to a seperate script file.

## My process

I built the HTML and CSS referencing my [product-preview-card](https://github.com/dquinn089/frontend-mentor-product-preview-card) project, which made building the design much easier and faster. Next was building the `.links` container, which was a bit of a challenge figuring out how to style and position it to overlap other elements. So far what I've worked with, elements are usually on the same level or layer and display around each other, so this was new. Finally implementing the script, first implementing the click function with EventListeners, to then implementing the sharing function, which takes the live server url of this project, and automatically copy and pastes the url on that websites share page. Finally for fun, using some Javascript and CSS to add an animation to the `.links` pop-up window.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Learned about the new styling methods and properties, when building the layout for the `.links` element. Learned about the DOM, and its uses when implementing JS, as well as being able to set design properties of elements using JS.

### Continued development

While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.

## Acknowledgments

- Thank you to [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home), having a community working on the same learning paths has been a wonderful resource and a huge help.
- Of Course thank you to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), always coming in handy.

P.S. I only noticed the example for Mobile-Active-Design until last minute. May update to fix in the future, but otherwise, hopefully the styling I settled with is up to par.
